This file describes some limitations or misfeatures lftp has.


* Glob over ftp is unreliable (server dependent) when not only last path
  component contains wildcards, e.g. */*.

Reason: currently lftp gets the whole directory listing and performs
pattern filtering locally, to make it consistent over various ftp servers
(and not only ftp). The trouble is that it is not known whether ftp server
does glob itself and whether it provides backslash quotation. So if glob of
first directory component gives a file name with wildcards, then getting
listing of that directory (the one which has wildcards in its name) will
get trouble if the wildcards will be expanded by server.

So currently lftp ignores wildcards in path before last component and sends
it to server. Fortunately, most ftp servers expand wildcards and send back
listing of all matching directories, so this mostly works.

(glob = wildcard expansion)
