Q: I have compile/link problems.
A: Some common installation problems are described in the INSTALL file.
   If your case is not covered, please send problem report.

Q: How can I see greeting message from server?
A: Try `debug 3'. It is disabled by default to keep screen clear in case
   of several simultaneous connections.

Q: Why doesn't lftp download files like this: `lftp ftp://host/path/file'?
A: It expects an URL of directory. To download a file use `lftpget URL'.

Q: What is the %2F in ftp URL's?
A: RFC1738 specifies that clients handling ftp URL's should interpret them
   as HOME relative by default. %2F stands for leading slash pointing to
   root directory.

Q: Why do secure protocols https and ftps give "PRNG not seeded" error message?
A: Your system probably lacks /dev/random-like device. Create ~/.rnd file
   containing random characters and SSL will work. See also OpenSSL FAQ
   about this.

Q: Why does lftp say that locking fails all the time? (on linux)
A: You have compiled lftp with large file support (>2G) but your kernel
   does not support 64 bit file locking. Either install a better kernel
   (e.g. linux-2.4.x) or compile lftp without large file support
   (configure --disable-largefile)

Q: Where is lls?
A: !ls

Q: Why doesn't mirror download files starting with a dot? I can see the files
   using `ls -a'.
A: Try `set ftp:list-options -a'.
